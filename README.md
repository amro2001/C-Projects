# C++ Projects

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects undertaken during an academic semester for learning purposes. The projects cover various aspects of programming, including algorithmic problem-solving, object-oriented programming, and application development.

## Overview

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**: A classic implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game with a simple user interface for two players.

2. **Number Guessing Game**: A number guessing game challenging the player to guess a number between 1 and 1000 within ten questions, using a binary search algorithm.

3. **Rational Number Calculator**: A C++ program performing basic operations on rational fractions, demonstrating operator overloading and mathematical operations.

4. **Vector Operations**: A template class for vector operations in N-dimensional space, showcasing the use of templates in C++.

5. **Hangman Game**: A text-based Hangman game where the player guesses letters in an uppercase word without a visual hangman representation.

## Purpose

These projects were developed as part of an academic curriculum to reinforce programming concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios. The projects cover a range of topics, providing hands-on experience with different aspects of C++ programming.

## Folder Structure

- Each project is organized into a dedicated folder.
- The source code and implementation details are available in each project's folder.
- README files provide additional insights into the project structure and key concepts applied.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders for a deeper understanding of the implementation details and the learning objectives achieved during the development of these projects.
